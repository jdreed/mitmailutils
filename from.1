from \- who is my mail from?
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B from [-s sender] [-h host] [
\fB\-v \fR|\fB -r] [-d] [-u \fR|\fB -p] [-?] [user]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I from 
program prints out the mail header lines in your incoming mail
to show you who your mail is from.  It does this by checking for mail
on a POP server and then looking for mail in the local spool
directory.  This command does not retrieve the mail from the post
office or the spool directory.

.I from 
understands the following options:

should run in debug mode.
