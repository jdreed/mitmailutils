.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I from 
program prints out the mail header lines in your incoming mail
to show you who your mail is from.  It does this by looking for mail
in the local spool directory and then checking for mail marked as
unseen on the post office server.  This command does not retrieve the
mail from the post office or the spool directory.

If no mail is waiting,
.I from
is silent unless one of
.BR -v ", " -r ", or " -t
is used, in which case it prints "You don't have any mail waiting."
If the
.B -n
option is used,
.I from
is always silent if there is no mail.

.I from 
understands the following options:
.TP
.B \-s \fIsender\fR
specifies that only headers for mail from
.I sender
are printed.
.TP
.B \-h \fIhost\fR
specifies that
.I host
should be consulted instead of your default post office server.
.TP
.B \-m \fImailbox\fR
specifies that the IMAP folder named
.I mailbox
should be checked.  For example, to check your MIT spam screening folder,
specify \fI-m INBOX.Spamscreen\fR.  If this option is not specified,
.I from
checks the INBOX folder.
.TP
.B \-A
specifies that all messages in the IMAP mailbox should be checked,
instead of only unseen messages.
.TP
.B \-N
specifies that only messages marked as new in the IMAP mailbox should
be checked, instead of unseen messages.
.TP
.B \-v
specifies that any To, Date, or Subject fields should be displayed
also, as well as a banner line list the number of messages waiting.
.TP
.B \-r
specifies that the From and Subject fields should be listed both on
the same line.  If multiple subject fields occur in the message only
the first one encounter will be listed.
.TP
.B \-t
specifies that only the total number of messages waiting should be
printed.
.TP
.B \-d
specifies that 
.I from
should run in debug mode.
.TP
.B \-u
specifies that only the local mail drop should be checked.
.TP
.B \-p
specifies that only the post office server should be checked.
.TP
.B \-?
specifies that usage information should be printed, no mail check
occurs.
.TP
.B \fIuser\fR
specifies that mail for 
.I user
should be checked, rather than the current user.
